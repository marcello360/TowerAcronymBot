# TowerAcronymBot ðŸŽ®

A Reddit bot that automatically detects and explains game acronyms in comments with progressively snarky responses. The bot helps new players decode the esoteric alphabet soup that veteran players casually throw around.

## Features

âœ… **Automatic Detection** - Scans subreddit comments for 125+ game acronyms (mods, cards, labs, workshop stats, etc.)  
âœ… **Smart Matching** - Space-delimited detection to avoid false positives  
âœ… **No Duplicates** - Tracks replied comments to prevent spam  
âœ… **Progressive Snark** - Gets increasingly snarky based on how many acronyms it finds (1-2 = helpful, 11+ = roasting)  
âœ… **GitHub Actions** - Runs automatically every 15 minutes  
âœ… **Easy Configuration** - Simple JSON file for adding/removing acronyms

## How It Works

The bot scans recent comments in the subreddit, detects acronyms from its database, and replies with explanations. The tone scales with the number of acronyms found - from friendly and helpful to hilariously exasperated.

## Snark Levels

The bot adjusts its personality based on acronym density:
- **1-2 acronyms**: Friendly and helpful
- **3-4 acronyms**: Mildly snarky
- **5-6 acronyms**: Getting snarky
- **7-8 acronyms**: Very snarky  
- **9-10 acronyms**: Maximum snark
- **11+ acronyms**: Nuclear snark
